## Why These Were Archived

### Historical Progress Tracking
These reports documented the implementation process as it happened (October 2025). They served their purpose during development but are now primarily of historical interest.

### Consolidation Benefits
The new **IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md** provides:
- **Chronological timeline** of all phases
- **Brief summaries** instead of full reports
- **Links to archived reports** for details
- **Focus on outcomes** not process

### What Was Preserved
IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md includes:
- ✅ All phase objectives and deliverables
- ✅ Duration and completion dates
- ✅ Key features implemented
- ✅ Integration points
- ✅ Links to full reports (these archived files)

### What Was Omitted
To keep the history concise:
- ❌ Step-by-step implementation details
- ❌ Code snippets and examples
- ❌ Detailed test results
- ❌ Complete file listings

**Note:** Full details remain in these archived reports.
